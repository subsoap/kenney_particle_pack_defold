# Kenney Particle Pack for Defold

ParticleFX effects for Defold made with the Kenney Particle Pack

If you use these you should move the sprites of each .particlefx to their own .atlas (you can have all share the same atlas). Try to have as small of an atlas, to have as few atlases as you can get. You can also resize the base size of the particle textures and then compensate in the initial size listed in the .particlefx files.
